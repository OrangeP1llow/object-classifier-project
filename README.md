# YOLO Object Classifier Project
Welcome to the Object Classifier Project, a powerful tool for object detection using the YOLOv8 algorithm. This project provides a user-friendly graphical interface to detect and classify objects in images and videos, making it suitable for both individual and batch processing.

## What Does This Program Do?
The Object Classifier is a Windows-based application designed for object detection and analysis. Key features include:

- **Single Detection Mode**: Upload a single image, video file, or use a webcam to detect objects. Adjust the confidence threshold (0-1) and view results with bounding boxes and labels in real-time. Results can be saved to an output folder.
- **Batch Detection Mode**: Process multiple images from a selected folder, save results in CSV or Excel formats, and monitor progress with a progress bar.
- **Information Mode**: Display system statistics (CPU, GPU, RAM usage) and application details.
- **Cross-Platform Ready**: Compiled into a standalone executable (`ObjectClassifierProject.exe`) that works on Windows without requiring Python or additional dependencies.

## How to run
1. Download the `ObjectClassifierProject_v1.0.zip` archive from [Releases](https://github.com/OrangeP1llow/object-classifier-project/releases).
2. Unzip the archive to any folder.
3. Run `ObjectClassifierProject.exe`, making sure `yolov8x.pt` is in the same folder.

## Source code
Sources are available in this folder. Python and libraries are required for compilation (see `requirements.txt`).
